            <h1>Future of the Web</h1>     
            <p>
When I think of the web I think of connection and not just little internet connection but the connection of people, ideas, and practices. You see, the internet has been a part of my life since I was a kid, so I’ve lived through the progression of the Internet. I never really knew how powerful the internet was because you only know the Internet for looking up answers or playing video games and for me as a kid I did both. As a kid, I loved the fact that I could search for anything in the world, and also for the entertainment aspect I could do anything I wanted. If you told me back in 2008 that the internet would be what it is today I would believe you. I would never doubt the advancement of technology just because it’s always a problem and it will always be someone trying to fix these problems. Whether it’s communication, medical or environmental, it pushes people to push technology further and further until there are no more problems….. but that’s very unrealistic and will probably never happen….. or would it? You see that way of thinking will cause humanity to stay in a box when you think of how impossible problems can be solved. The impossible becomes possible and if you possibly can do it then it’s no longer impossible. Just think about the creation of social media. If you told someone back in 1990 that you can create your small website dedicated to you, that would showcase the highlights of your life and millions of people would see it… that person would sound crazy right. In 1987 the direct processor of today’s internet came into being the national science foundation launched the more robust national wide digital networking known as the NSFNET. A decade later in 1997, the first true social media platform was created. My whole point is that it’s just a matter of time before the next big Technology advancement becomes a thing. This sparked my interest growing up because my dad was a Computer scientist for NASA. I didn’t really follow in his footsteps but just being exposed to the type of technology we had around the house and just from going to Science fairs and being at his job rubbed off on me. Which led me to become a computer science major in college, not saying that my father isn’t a good role model but I just didn’t like computer stuff because I wanted to be him or fill in his shoes. I liked it because I liked it and I have seen so much that you can do in the stem field. There are a bunch of different computer science categories but they are all kind of tied into each other, so if you know let’s say computer security it wouldn’t be hard for you to change it up and do gaming. For example, if I was an artist and I only used one brand of paint but I decided to switch up the brand of paint I used it wouldn’t be a drastic difference but it would be different. A lot of people switch their major to computer science because it’s so versatile in the world today that it will always be needed. If you know how to design websites and code on the back end….. just those two skills alone will make you rich and if you have a team of people who can do the same thing that you can do then you can start a company and now you're the new Facebook. Now that we’re on the topic of Facebook, let's talk about the meta-verse. This ambitious move from Facebook will probably be one of the best moves that they make because the fact that Facebook sees the potential of VR and how people like to interact with each other and not just a simple FaceTime call amazes me. I am excited to see what is to come. The meta-verse will not only be just a physical thing it will be environmental also. This makes it great for teaching, jobs, or people wanting to share their ideas with people across the world. Just taking Web Programming this semester opened my eyes to the things I can create. I've created maybe three websites and they’re all different but they also have the same function and every time I make a new website there’s always a slight improvement. I feel if I could put more time and effort into making the perfect website it would be a game-changer, because I created a website with a team of classmates and the process of making the website wasn’t bad. All of us had a part of the website to do and the most challenging part is compiling all of our codes. It just opened my eyes to the possibilities of layouts that a website can have. You see people want the most convenient and less stressful way to search for things and if a website is too cluttered then it could turn off a customer from searching and if it’s too bland then it looks sketchy. I’ve been trying to find the right balance between simplicity and also interactiveness. You see, what I want in a website is for everything to be interactive but suddenly I don’t want it to look like a kid made the website but I also don’t want it to look like it’s old. The best way to describe my style is more of a simplistic modern style of websites. I like more of the front-end aspect of web design because I like to be visual. Looking at code is OK but just seeing you put in a value and then going back and seeing the page change a different color is what Excites me. I hope to maybe one day start my own tag company and make a change. I don’t like the idea of working for someone else because I feel like other people don’t take into consideration YOU. I think that I would be a pretty understanding CEO and will try to make my workspace as clear and fair as possible. I understand that you can’t make everyone happy but what’s right is what’s right and what’s wrong is wrong. So I want to close this out by saying that I had a great time in Web Programming, I never thought that I would make so many websites that can be useful. It’s crazy to think that I thought this stuff was so impossible at one point but just taking one class can have you learn so much.

            <h1>Future of META</h1>     
            <p>
             
After doing some research and looking into Facebook‘s new meta-brand, I can say that I’m excited to see what this technology can accomplish. When I first heard of Meta I didn’t know what it meant but I had somewhat of an idea because of the video game world. The term meta is something that everyone uses, it's something new or something that’s being used everywhere. So when I think of meta, I can only reference the video game Call of Duty and the terms of people using meta weapons because it’s the best right now. Meta is Greek for “after” or “beyond” the overall Facebook company will now simply be called Meta as an immersive embodying the Internet. Meta is more than just Facebook or just an Internet platform, It’s an immersive way to connect with others, play games, and just ultimately be in places you never would have imagined. Although this idea is very over the top, something this ambitious will always have risks and while doing some research, I’ve discovered that matters of security will be developed from the start and will have features to block, authenticate and choose who you want to interact with. With something this ambitious, there’s always a risk and there’s always things such as the Cambridge analytical scandal (Facebook) that was secretly harvesting the personal data of millions of Facebook users and using their data for political gain. There are also ties in with the fake accounts that have been spam across Facebook. Facebook is such a large platform the scale of it is higher than YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snapchat and everything combined. With this large of a platform, you have to consider all types of attacks such as DDOS, internal attacks, and spying. To actually get into the meta-verse you have to use an oculus or some type of VR headset and since everything is vulnerable theoretically someone can hack these VR headsets and listen in on different conversations and maybe spy on whoever is using these devices. I am off for artificial intelligence and AI in VR because I see life in a different spectrum than what it just is. Some people who can’t walk may want to envision themselves walking and VR gives people that type of experience or just the experience of wanting to go to Paris or Tokyo, you can do all of that in the comfort of your home. If you want to talk to your family that’s across the country you can do that and it’s more personable due to the liveliness of it. Connecting with people through the matter versus just a simple FaceTime call or video chat it’s an interaction where you can interact with them, talk and see their facial expressions and their body movements. It's more of an uncanny valley of communication but in a good way. But when there's good, there’s also bad, some of the things that I can see being a problem in the future with the whole VR and AI systems are that all of these things can be manipulated. In some ways, it could be used as a malicious factor and some people just aren’t just comfortable with the idea of people not being people and AI replacing people. I think that the meta-verse if they do this right can change the future of the Internet for good.
